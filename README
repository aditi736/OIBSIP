Digital posters and flyers have to be visually appealing while
satisfactorily communicating a message to the public.
Creating posters and fliers for public relations and
marketing campaigns will expose you to scaling and proper
design layouts in digital platforms.
2.Task: LOGO 
Logos are a representation of what a brand or organization
stands for. They speak volumes about what companies do

logos, focusing on minimalism and the business’ core values.
This fundamental principle is suggestive of the power of
simplicity in graphic design.

company’s essence through excellent typography and some
ingenuity. 
5.Task: MAGAZINES AND BROCHURES
Designing the look and feel of a magazine or brochure is a

media.
